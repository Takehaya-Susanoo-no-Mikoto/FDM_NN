# Differential Equation Solver for Plasma Field using Finite Difference Method and Neural Networks
## Neural Network for Approximating a Function
This code implements a neural network for approximating a function using PyTorch.

The neural network uses the Softplus activation function and consists of three hidden layers with N * 12, N * 4, and N neurons, respectively.

The model is trained on data generated by solving a differential equation using the finite difference method with the coefficients determined by a given set of parameters.

### Requirements
This code requires the following libraries:

- os
- random
- numpy
- torch
- torch.nn
- torch.optim
- sklearn.model_selection
- torch.utils.data
